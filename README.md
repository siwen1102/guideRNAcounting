This is a sample technical coding test for entry-level bioinformatics Engineer posted on the [Medium](https://epicbio.medium.com/engineeringinterviewblogpost-63cccd202672).


### Problem Statement

The goal of this question is to assess the candidateâ€™s familiarity with sequence algorithms and Python programming skills. Accordingly, there are several levels to the solution to this problem.

### Solution

Reading in a fastq file and extract the sequences
Computing the spacer counts

|     | spacer               | count |
| --- | -------------------- | ----- |
| 0   | AAGTGAGCTCTTACGGGAAT | 29    |
| 1   | GAATGTAGTTTTAGCCCTCC | 16    |
| 2   | GGGATTCTATTTAGCCCGCC | 17    |
| 3   | TCTGATGATACCCATGCCAC | 25    |
| 4   | AGATTCACAGAGGCAACCTG | 28    |

Arranging the results into specific formats (csv, text, excel, sql)
